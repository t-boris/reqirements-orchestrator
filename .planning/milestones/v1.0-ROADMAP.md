# Milestone v1.0: MVP

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-14
**Phases:** 1-10
**Total Plans:** 43

## Overview

Build a Slack bot that acts as a proactive business analyst, driving thread-based conversations to gather requirements and create Jira tickets. The journey moves from infrastructure (database, LLM) through core agent logic (ReAct loop, skills) to integrations (Slack, Jira) and finally deployment.

### Phase 2: Database Layer
**Goal**: PostgreSQL connection, models for project_context and thread state, LangGraph checkpointer
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 3 plans

- [x] 04-05: Zep integration - storage + search API
- [x] 04-06: Knowledge Graph schema + constraint storage
- [x] 04-07: Document processing - PDF, DOCX, MD, TXT
- [x] 04-08: Dedup suggestions - high-confidence, non-blocking
- [x] 04-09: Contradiction detector - structured matching

### Phase 5: Agent Core
**Goal**: LangGraph ReAct agent loop, AgentState management, extraction/validation/decision cycle
**Depends on**: Phase 2, Phase 3, Phase 4
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:

### Phase 6: Skills
**Goal**: Implement skills: ask_user, preview_ticket for agent to call with interrupt/resume pattern
**Depends on**: Phase 5
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 06-01: ask_user skill + interrupt/resume + semantic answer matching
- [x] 06-02: preview_ticket skill + version checking + approval records
- [x] 06-03: Edit modal + skill dispatcher + tool binding

### Phase 7: Jira Integration
**Goal**: Jira API service with transactional operations, strict approval validation, and duplicate detection
**Depends on**: Phase 6
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 07-01: JiraService client with retry/backoff, dry-run, env separation
- [x] 07-02: jira_create skill with approval validation, idempotency, audit trail
- [x] 07-03: jira_search skill for duplicate detection before preview

### Phase 8: Global State
**Goal**: Channel context system from root messages, pinned content, and Jira history
**Depends on**: Phase 7

### Phase 10: Deployment
**Goal**: Docker container configuration, environment setup, production deployment to GCE VM
**Depends on**: All previous phases
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 10-01: Dockerfile and docker-compose
- [x] 10-02: Environment configuration
- [x] 10-03: Production deployment scripts

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Thread-scoped sessions (one thread = one ticket)
- ReAct loop over rigid phases
- PostgreSQL only (no Zep)
- Direct Atlassian API (no MCP)
- Gemini as default LLM
- Socket Mode over HTTP endpoints
- Persistent background event loop for async in sync handlers

**Issues Resolved:**
- AsyncPostgresSaver initialization pattern
- Gemini response parsing (list content blocks)
- Event loop binding for asyncio locks
- Postgres version compatibility on deploy

**Issues Deferred:**
- Conversation history fetching (v1.1)
- Improved onboarding UX (v1.1)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None significant
